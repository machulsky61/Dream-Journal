# Dream Journal Analysis

Final [Data Laboratory](https://github.com/machulsky61/Data-Laboratory) project, whose objective was to put into practice everything learned throughout the course.

We worked on posts from www.dreamjournal.net forum in which we found out; What those who publish dream and what type of dreams readers enjoy most. As a bonus-track we cross the data obtained with the lottery data to test the popular Argentine belief about numbers and dreams.

Made in Python, using Web Scraping techniques, Data Frame curation, Data Visualization and Classification, Natural Language Processing and Regression Models.
